It was reported with an accuracy of 84% on the test data which is consistent with its training accuracy. It provided actionable insights and this makes it a suitable choice for healthcare application. The following Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the decision tree:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model Training Scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Decision Tree"

Specifically, blood sugar (BS) with a threshold value of 7.95 mmol/L was the primary splitting point in the root node Decision Tree. The Decision tree also suggested that systolic (lower) blood pressure is a key indicator as it was used to refine the classification further on."

    "text": "Limitations\nAlthough the model performed well overall, it has limitations which require careful attention before the actual deployment in the clinical settings. Such limitations can be identified as:\n\nMisclassifications: Some high-risk pregnancies were inccorectly categorised as low risk. This could have severe consequences in the real world scenarios.\nDataset Bias: The dataset has limited diversity which could introduce bias. It primarily includes data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which may not generalize well to broader populations."

    "text": "Potential Impact\nThe ability to predict maternal health risks early can transform healthcare delivery in underserved communities. By having the ability to identify at risk pregnancies, healthcare professionals can prioritize resouces and provide timely interventions to the patients. This will be a vital change especially in rural areas where medical care is often scarce."

    "text": "Challenges in Deployment\nData Diversity is one of the key challenges. Future work should involve training models on larger and more diverse datasets to ensure the models can generalise better. Secondly, ethical considerations should be taken seriously. Using machine learning in healthcare requires substantial careful consideration of faireness, accountability and transparency."
