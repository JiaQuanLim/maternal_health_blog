    "text": "Hello there, as an aspiring student currently pursuing my Master of Data Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC), I am passionate about exploring the immense power data holds to transform information into impactful solutions. Getting into this program is not just a step forward in my career and it’s one of my proudest goals for 2024 that represent my dedication to continuous learning and growth in this ever-evolving field.\nMy academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems in Malaysia, where I gained a solid foundation in technology and analytics. Now at UBC, I’m building upon that knowledge with advanced data science skills to focus on practical applications that solve real-world problems.\nBeyond my technical expertise, I am known for being an effective communicator and a natural leader. I thrive on collaboration, leading projects, and fostering team success whenever the opportunity arises. I am also a good listener, as I believe it is one of the most important traits for truly understanding others’ perspectives and cultivate trust within teams.\nOutside of my professional pursuits, I balance my life with a love for badminton and hiking, activities that keep me energised and grounded. These hobbies not only fuel my sense of adventure but also sharpen my strategic thinking and resilience."

    "text": "Model Performance\nIn Figure 1, the Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the training data which outperform other models. It was reported with an accuracy of 84% on the test data which is consistent with its training accuracy. It provided actionable insights and this makes it a suitable choice for healthcare application. The following Figure 2 shows a simplified version of the decision tree:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Model Training Scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Decision Tree"

    "text": "Key Indicators\nThe Decision Tree (Figure 2) has identified that blood sugars levels as the most critical predictor of maternal health risks. Specifically, blood sugar (BS) with a threshold value of 7.95 mmol/L was the primary splitting point in the root node Decision Tree. The Decision tree also suggested that systolic (lower) blood pressure is a key indicator as it was used to refine the classification further on."

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nAlthough the model performed well overall, it has limitations which require careful attention before the actual deployment in the clinical settings. Such limitations can be identified as:\n\nMisclassifications: Some high-risk pregnancies were inccorectly categorised as low risk. This could have severe consequences in the real world scenarios.\nDataset Bias: The dataset has limited diversity which could introduce bias. It primarily includes data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which may not generalize well to broader populations."

    "text": "Potential Impact\nThe ability to predict maternal health risks early can transform healthcare delivery in underserved communities. By having the ability to identify at risk pregnancies, healthcare professionals can prioritize resouces and provide timely interventions to the patients. This will be a vital change especially in rural areas where medical care is often scarce."

    "text": "Challenges in Deployment\nData Diversity is one of the key challenges. Future work should involve training models on larger and more diverse datasets to ensure the models can generalise better. Secondly, ethical considerations should be taken seriously. Using machine learning in healthcare requires substantial careful consideration of faireness, accountability and transparency."
