# How Data Science Can Save Lives

Maternal health remains a critical global issue, especially in the rural and underserved areas where access to healthcare is limited.
High maternal mortality rates are often the result of insufficient monitoring, lack of medical resources, and limited information about maternal care [@maternal_death_causes].
With that said, by leveraging data science, we can identify health risks early during pregnancy which could potentially save the lives of mothers and their babies.
This blog dives into how the data driven methods can predict maternal health risks and highlight the key indicators to facilitate healthcare decisions. 

# Methods

In order for us to this issue, we have analysed a dataset that contains health metrics from rural communities. 
The dataset was sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database [@Pima_indians_data].
It includes the following non-invasive health indicators such as:

- **Age:** The age of the pregnant woman in years
- **Blood Pressure:** Both systolic (upper) and diastolic (lower) values in (in mmHg)
- **Blood Sugar (BS):** Blood glucose levels (in mmol/L)
- **Heart Rate:** Resting heart rate (in beats per minute)
- **Risk Level:** The predicted intensity of maternal health risk (high, medium, or low)

We have tested multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees.
Our primary goal was to build a predicitve model that is capable of categorizing maternal health risks into three levels (high, medium, low).
Among these models, the Decision Tree stood out for its interpretability and high accuracy.

# Results

## Model Performance

In @fig-model_scores, the Decision Tree model achieved an accuracy of 82% on the training data which outperform other models. It was reported with an accuracy of 84% on the test data which is consistent with its training accuracy. 
It provided actionable insights and this makes it a suitable choice for healthcare application. 
The following @fig-decision_tree shows a simplified version of the decision tree:

## Key Indicators

The Decision Tree (@fig-decision_tree) has identified that blood sugars levels as the most critical predictor of maternal health risks.
Specifically, blood sugar (BS) with a threshold value of 7.95 mmol/L was the primary splitting point in the root node Decision Tree.
The Decision tree also suggested that systolic (lower) blood pressure is a key indicator as it was used to refine the classification further on.



## Limitations

Although the model performed well overall, it has limitations which require careful attention before the actual deployment in the clinical settings.
Such limitations can be identified as:

- **Misclassifications:** Some high-risk pregnancies were inccorectly categorised as low risk. This could have severe consequences in the real world scenarios.
- **Dataset Bias:** The dataset has limited diversity which could introduce bias. It primarily includes data from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which may not generalize well to broader populations.

# Real World Implications

## Potential Impact

The ability to predict maternal health risks early can transform healthcare delivery in underserved communities. 
By having the ability to identify at risk pregnancies, healthcare professionals can prioritize resouces and provide timely interventions to the patients.
This will be a vital change especially in rural areas where medical care is often scarce.

## Challenges in Deployment

Data Diversity is one of the key challenges. Future work should involve training models on larger and more diverse datasets to ensure the models can generalise better.
Secondly, ethical considerations should be taken seriously. Using machine learning in healthcare requires substantial careful consideration of faireness, accountability and transparency.

# Conclusion
Once again, data science has demostrated the potential in addressing critical maternal health challenges. 
This project highlights how predicitve models like Decision Tree, can identify key risk factors such as blood sugar and systolic (lower) blood pressure to guide healthcare decisions.
However, it is important to note that further refinement and validation are necessary before deploying the model in the real world settings.
Collaboration between data scientist and healthcare professionals is another key aspect to unlocking the full potential of data science.
In a nutshell, by leveraging data driven insights, we have the potential to make a difference toward improving maternal healthcare and save lives.
